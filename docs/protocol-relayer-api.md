# The Relayer API

## Introduction

The **Relayer API** is the only access point required to use the Socialcap voting protocol, including Identity registration, Group membership and the Application features required for the Anonymous Batch Voting process.

It is  composed of:

- **Messages** sent to the Relayer (some NATS.io server). 
- **Subjects** to which the Relayer suscribes and listens. 
- **Objects** managed by the Relayer that keep the persistent state.
- **Workers** to whom the Relayer will delegate some tasks. 

### Messages

There are two main groups of messages that the Relayer receives and responds:

- **Semaphore messages**. These are messages that implement the basic features of the Semaphore protocol, and are not binded to any particular application.

- **Application messages**. These are the messages related to the Socialcap Voting application itself.

Here is the **Index** of all messages:

- [registerIdentity]()
- [registerGroup]()
- [registerMember]()
- [proveMembership]()
- [registerCommunity]()
- [registerPlan]()
- [registerValidator]()
- [registerAuditor]()
- [registerClaim]()
- [assignElectors]() 
- [retrieveAssignments]() 
- [receiveVotes]()
- [processBatches]()

Some messages may be needed to manage (update/remove) the basic entities (identity, group, community, plan, claim, validators and auditors), but are not yet implemented:

- removeIdentity
- removeGroup
- removeCommunity
- removeClaim
- removeValidator
- removeAuditor

#### General structure

All messages are sent using the `postRequest` method included in the Socialcap Protocol SDK. It sends a request to the `socialcap:protocol` subject where the Relayer is listening.

The usual **Request** is done using:

~~~
let response = await postRequest('command', { params });	
~~~

Where:

- `command` is the request action itself
- `params` is an object containing required and optional params 

The **Response** will always be of the form:
~~~
{ 
  success: true | false, 
  error: { message: string, reason?: string } | null
  data: any | null
}  
~~~
Where:
- If the **request is successful**: success = true, error = null, and data contains the response data.
- If the **request fails**: success = false, data = null, and error contains the error messages.

### Subjects

- `socialcap:protocol`: Anyone can send a request to these subject. The Relayer will be listening on this subject and will respond. 

- `socialcap:tasks`: Only the Relayer or other Workers can publish to this subject. Only the Workers will be listening to this subject.

- ` socialcap:api`: Only the Workers can publish to this subject. Only the API listener will be listening to this subject.

- `socialcap:notifications` : Anyone can publish notifications.

- `socialcap:news.all`: Anyone can listen to this news subject, where news for all are published.

- `socialcap:news.group.*`: Any group can listen to this news subject, where news for a particular group are published.

- ``socialcap:news.personal.*`: Any user can listen to this news subject, where news for a particular person are published.

### Objects

The Relayer uses a centralized high performance key-value store, based on LMDB to persist all its objects and state. 

All objects have a _unique key_ (which MUST be a string) and a _value_ (where the value can be any data). Objects are usually of two types:

A **data object** which can contain any data.

- `identities.${identityCommitment}`: contains the identity data.
- `communities.${uid}`: contains the community data.
- `plans.${uid}`: contains the plan data.
- `claims.${uid}`: contains the basic claim data.
- `batches.${hash}`: contains a batch of votes for a set of claims in a plan, coming from a given identity .
- `assignments.${identityCommitment}`: contains the list of plans+claims assigned to this elector.
- `proofs.${claimUid}`: contains the proof obtained by the recursive rollup voting on this claim.  

It is important to note here that only the minimal information required for the voting process is used and stored here. For example, we don't need all info from the claim, just the basic info and the references to the community, plan and applicant. 

An **Indexed Merkle Map (IMM)**, used to store the Group members, where the leaf key is a Field(uid) and the leaf value is usually Field(1) to indicate existence, though it may be any other Field value.

- `global.0.identities`: the global IMM that indicates existence of a given identity. Leaf: `${commitment},1`.
- `global.0.nullifiers`: the global IMM that indicates that a given nullifier has been used. Leaf: `${nullifier},1`.
- `communities.${communityUid}.members`: the IMM that indicates existence of a given person in the given community. Leaf: `${personUid},1`.
- `communities.${communityUid}.plans`: the IMM that indicates existence of a given plan in the given community. Leaf: `${planUid},1`.
- `communities.${communityUid}.claims`: the IMM that indicates existence of a given claim in the given community. Leaf: `${claimUid},1`.
- `communities.${communityUid}.validators`: the IMM that indicates existence of a given validator in the given community. Leaf: `${identityCommitment},1`.
- `communities.${communityUid}.auditors`: the IMM that indicates existence of a given auditor in the given community. Leaf: `${identityCommitment},1`.
- `plans.${planUid}.claims`:  the IMM that indicates existence of a given claim in the given plan. Leaf: `${claimUid},1`.
- `plans.${planUid}.batches`:  the IMM that indicates existence of a given batch in the given plan. Leaf: `${batchUid},1`.
- `claims.${claimUid}.electors`:  the IMM that indicates existence of a given elector in the given claim. Leaf: `${identityCommitment},1`.
- `claims.${claimUid}.nullifiers`: the IMM that indicates that a given nullifier has been used for this claim. Leaf: `${nullifier},1`.

## Identity

This requests manage the registration and removal of an identity. These messages are part of the standard Semaphore messages.

### registerIdentity

Registers a new Semaphore identity. This is a global registration not tied to any particular group.

The identity needs to be created using the [createIdentity]() method and proved using the [proveIdentityOwnership]() method included in the Socialcap protocol SDK.

**Request**
```
let response = await postRequest('registerIdentity', {
    commitment: string,
    pk: string,
    proofOfIdentity: string,
    signature: string, 
    ts: string
});	
```
Where:
- `commitment`  is the identity commitment.
- `pk` is the public key of this identity needed to verify signatures.
- `proofOfIdentity` is the proof (stringified) that the user really owns this identity. 
- `signature` the identity owner signature (stringified).
- `ts` the timestamp (ms) used as a nonce

**Permissions**

Anyone can register an identity if he/she can prove that he owns it.

New identities will be registered in the global group `global.0.identities` that is open to anyone, and this group is the one that will be tested to check if an identity is registered. 

**Actions**

When the request is received the following happens:
- Check the identity has not been previosly registered, or raise an error.
- Verify the proof, or raise an error.
- Check the identity owner signature or raise an error
- Check the signature of message [commitment, ts]
- Create an exclusive encryption key pair for this identity.
- Add an entry in KVS with the received identity data and the new keypair.
- Add this identity to the `global.0.identities` group.

**Response**
~~~
{ 
  success: true, error: false,
  data: { 
    encryptionKey: string
  }
}  
~~~
Where:
- `encryptionKey` is the exclusive encryption public key created by the service and given to the user for sending encrypted messages to the service.

### removeIdentity 

***NOT IMPLEMENTED***

This will remove the identity from the global register, the `global.0.identities` group.

NOTE: It will NOT remove it from the other groups in which it was included. BUT all tests for membership SHOULD check that the identity has not been removed, so the membership proof MUST fail if it was removed.

**Request**
```
let response = await postRequest('removeIdentity', {
    commitment: string,
    proofOfIdentity: string,
    signature: string, 
});	
```
Where:
- `commitment`  is the identity commitment.
- `proofOfIdentity` is the proof (stringified) that the user really owns this identity. 
- `signature` the identity owner signature (stringified).

**Permissions**

Anyone can remove its identity from the global register, if it can prove that he/she owns the identity.

**Actions**

When the request is received the following happens:
- Check the identity has been previosly registered, or raise an error.
- Verify the proof, or raise an error.
- Check the identity owner signature or raise an error
- Remove the entry from KVS.
- Remove this identity from the `global.0.identities` group.

## Groups

This set of requests manage the creation/removal on groups and how to add or remove members to it. These messages are part of the standard Semaphore messages.

### registerGroup

Registers a new Semaphore group. 

**Request**

~~~~
postRequest('registerGroup', {
  guid: string,
  address?: string,
  owner?: string,
  signature?: string,
  ts: number
})	
~~~~

Where:
- `guid` is the Guid of the Semaphore group we want to register. A Guid usually takes the form `prefix.${uid}.items`, but it is really open to any string pattern which can provide a universal unique key.
- `address` is an _optional_ address (or publick key) related to this particular group. It is different to the owner, but can be eventually be the same.
- `owner` is the _optional_ public key owner of this group. Please note that any identity can act as owner of a group, if it is able to sign its future messages.
- `signature` is the _optional_ signature required when we register a group with an owner.
- `ts`  the timestamp (ms) used as a nonce

**Permissions**

Anyone can register a group, but if the group is registered with an optional owner, only the owner can add members to it.

**Actions**

When the request is received the following happens:
- Check the group has not been previously registered, or raise an error.
- Verify the signature, or raise an error.
- Add an entry in KVS with the received group data.

**Response**
~~~
{ 
  success: true, error: false,
  data: { 
    guid: string,   // the received GroupUid
    hash: string,   // the Group hash 
    size: string,   // size of the Group, initially 1 (initial leaf is 0,0)
    root: string,   // root of the IndexedMerkleMap
    status: string  // state of the Group, 'ACTIVE'
  }
}
~~~

### removeGroup

### registerMember

Registers the given identity as member of the given group. The identity and the group needs to have been previosuly registered.

**Request**

```
let response = await postRequest('registerMember', {
    guid: string,
    commitment: string,
    signature: string,
    ts: number
});	
```
Where:
- `guid` is the Guid of the Semaphore group where we want to add this member.
- `commitment`  is the identity commitment of the new member.
- `signature` is the member signature that needs to accompany the proof.
- `ts`  the timestamp (ms) used as a nonce

**Permissions**

If the group has no owner, the registration in the group is open to anyone.

If the group has an owner, the owner is the only one who can add members to it, and so the request can be denied if the group owner rejects it.

The global group `global.0.identities` is open to anyone. All identities are also registered here.

**Actions**

When the request is received the following happens:
- Check the identity has been previosly registered, or raise an error.
- Check the Guid exists, or raise an error.
- Verify the proof, or raise an error.
- Check the identity owner signature or raise an error.
- Add this identity to the indicated `guid` group.

**Response**
~~~
{ 
  success: true, error: false,
  data: { 
    encryptionKey: string
  }
}  
~~~

Where:
- `encryptionKey` is the exclusive encryption public key created by the service and given to the user for sending encrypted messages to the service.

### removeMember 


### proveMembership


## Application

### registerCommunity

Registers a community that will latter create campaign plans, receive claims and act as issuer of credentials

**Request**

~~~
postRequest('registerCommunity', {
  uid: string,
  address?: string,
  name?: string,
  owner: string,
  signature: string,
  ts: number
})	
~~~

Where:
- `uid` is the Uid of the community existent in the API and Indexer.
- `address` _optional_ public key of this community (a MINA public key).
- `name` _optional_ fantasy name given to the community.
- `owner` is the owner who can change groups related to this community. In some cases it can be the same as the 'address', but in Socialcap usually is the special Socialcap API account that will sign all future changes to this community.
- `signature` is the signature required when we register a community with an owner.
- `ts`  the timestamp (ms) used as a nonce

**Permissions**

Anyone can register a community, but only the owner can add members to it. 

If the community has not been registered with an owner, anyone can add members or add itself to it (we call this a fully open community). **NOTE**: this is not yet available.

**Actions**

When registering a community, with a given 'guid' and 'address', the following will happen:
- Check the community has not been registered, or raise an error.
- Verify the signature of message [owner, ts], or raise an error.
- Add an entry in KVS with all received community data and props.
- Register a group `community.${uid}.plans` with 'owner' or no owner.
- Register a group `community.${uid}.members` with 'owner' or no owner.
- Register a group `community.${uid}.claims` with 'owner' or no owner.

Validators and auditors must give a proof that they are such when calling the [registerValidator]() or [registerAuditor]() request. 

In this case only the protocol itself can add them to the community groups AFTER verifying the received proof. So the following groups are strictly owned by the Protocol and only the Protocol can add members to them.

- Register a group `community.${uid}.validators` with 'owner = protocol'.
- Register a group `community.${uid}.auditors` with 'owner = protocol'.

**Response**
~~~
{ 
  success: true, error: false,
  data: { done: true }

When registering a plan, with a given 'uid', the following will happen:
- Check the communityUid has been registered, or raise an error.
- Check the planUid has been registered, or raise an error.
- Verify the signature, or raise an error.
- Get the strategy from the `plans.${planUid}` data.

For each claim in claims: 
- Check if the claim belongs to the community and plan, or raise an error.
- Select electors for the claim according to the plan strategy.
- Add the selected electors to the  group `claims.${uid}.electors`.
- Change the claim status to ASSIGNED if no errors, 
- Or add the errors to the claim errors if they exist.

Finally for each selected elector:
- Collect all claims for the electors
- Add the assigned claims to the `assignments.${identityCommitment}` object.

**Response**
~~~
{ 
  success: true, error: false,
   data: {
